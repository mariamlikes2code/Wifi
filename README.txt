Introduction
The WiFiDeviceProject is a project that illustrates key principles of object-oriented programming, 
with a focus on abstract classes and their practical application. This README provides insights into 
the code processes and an exploration of how the project aligns with fundamental Java concepts.


Code Overview
The core of the project revolves around the WifiDevice abstract class, representing a blueprint for 
WiFi-enabled devices. This abstract class encapsulates common features such as name and ipAddress. 
The Router and Smartphone classes extend WifiDevice, demonstrating the use of inheritance to create 
specialized classes.
The "connectToWifi" method declared in the WifiDevice abstract class is an abstract method without 
implementation. Subclasses (Router and Smartphone) provide their own concrete implementations, relating 
to the principle of abstraction.
Encapsulation is actively practiced, encapsulating data within classes allows for efficiency for the 
programmer to code cleaner and more concise code.
Polymorphism is illustrated through method overriding, allowing a single method name to exhibit different 
behaviors in subclasses.
The WifiDeviceDemo class introduces a menu-based user interface, demonstrating interactive user input 
and the use of conditional statements. This enriches the user experience and showcases practical 
application scenarios.


Lessons Learned and Java Principles
The project provides an understanding of abstract classes and inheritance, showcasing the benefits 
of code reuse and the creation of class hierarchies. Encapsulation is actively practiced, encapsulating 
data within classes and promoting modular design. This enhances code organization and readability.
Polymorphism is illustrated through method overriding, allowing a single method name to exhibit different
behaviors in subclasses. Though not explicitly using interfaces, the project's structure aligns with 
the principles of interfaces by promoting a clear contract (abstract class) for its subclasses to 
implement.


Conclusion
The WiFiDeviceProject serves as an educational exploration of Java's object-oriented programming 
principles. Through abstract classes, inheritance, and other fundamental concepts, it provides a practical
foundation for understanding Java's capabilities. The compilation process and code overview presented
in this README aim to facilitate comprehension and engagement with the project, promoting a deeper 
understanding of Java programming principles.
